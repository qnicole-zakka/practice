What is PyTorch, and how does it differ from other deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow?

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is known for its dynamic computation graph, which allows for more flexibility and intuitive model building compared to TensorFlow's static computation graph.
How do you create a tensor in PyTorch?

You can create a tensor using torch.Tensor(), torch.tensor(), or other specialized functions like torch.zeros() and torch.ones().
Explain the concept of autograd in PyTorch.

Autograd is PyTorch's automatic differentiation library, which tracks operations on tensors to compute gradients for backpropagation.
What is a PyTorch nn.Module and how is it used to define neural networks?

nn.Module is a base class for defining neural network architectures in PyTorch. It allows you to create custom neural network layers and models by defining a forward method.
How do you transfer a PyTorch model between CPU and GPU?

You can move a model to the GPU using model.to('cuda') and back to the CPU using model.to('cpu').
Explain the forward pass and backward pass in PyTorch.

The forward pass involves applying the model to input data to compute predictions. The backward pass computes gradients using autograd for gradient-based optimization algorithms.
What is a loss function in PyTorch, and why is it important in training neural networks?

A loss function quantifies the error between predicted and actual values. It is crucial for training neural networks as it guides the optimization process by providing a measure of how well the model is performing.
What is the purpose of the DataLoader in PyTorch?

DataLoader is used for creating batches of data and handling data loading and shuffling during training. It is essential for efficient training with large datasets.
Explain the steps involved in training a deep learning model in PyTorch.

Preprocess data, define the model architecture, choose a loss function, select an optimization algorithm, train the model using a training loop, and evaluate the model.
How do you save and load trained PyTorch models?

You can save a model's state using torch.save() and load it using torch.load().
What are some common techniques for preventing overfitting in PyTorch models?

Techniques include dropout, weight decay, early stopping, and using more training data.
What is the purpose of the torchvision library in PyTorch?

torchvision provides datasets, models, and utilities for computer vision tasks. It simplifies tasks like loading image datasets and using pre-trained models.
